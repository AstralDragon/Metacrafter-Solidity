# MyToken Smart Contract

A simple Ethereum token contract that allows minting and burning of tokens.

## Description

MyToken is a basic Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It implements a custom token with functionalities to mint new tokens and burn existing ones. The contract keeps track of token balances for different addresses and manages the total supply of tokens.

Key features:
- Minting new tokens
- Burning existing tokens
- Tracking token balances for addresses
- Managing total token supply

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this smart contract, you'll need an Ethereum development environment. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
2. Install Truffle, a development framework for Ethereum:
```
npm install -g truffle
```
3. Clone this repository or copy the contract code into a new file named `MyToken.sol`

## Help

If you encounter any issues:

- Make sure you're using Solidity version 0.8.18 or compatible
- Check that you have sufficient ETH in your account for gas fees
- Verify that you're calling the functions with the correct parameters
